<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Abhishek Kumar.</p>
<p>I’m a Computer Science undergrad at IIIT Kalyani, passionate about turning ideas into code. I love building web apps, intelligent systems, and user-friendly designs that make an impact.</p>

<p>Tech I work with: C, Python, Java, React, SQL, AWS</p>
<p>Interests: Web Dev • DSA • Machine Learning</p>
<p>Projects I’m proud of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CampusConnects – a React-based platform for campus communities</li>
  <li>Restaurant Management System – a Java + MySQL app for menu & billing</li>
  <li>Loan Management System – a desktop app for managing loans & EMIs</li>
</ul>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess ♟️ (I represented my institute at the Inter-IIIT Chess Competition).</p>

<p>Always curious. Always learning. Always building.</p>
